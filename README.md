Introduction
The RealTime Handwriting Recognition System is a machine learning-based application designed to recognize and convert handwritten text into digital text in real-time. This project leverages Python libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras to process and classify handwritten characters. It is aimed at developers and researchers interested in the field of handwriting recognition.

Features
Real-time handwriting recognition using a webcam or external camera.
Preprocessing of input images for noise reduction and better accuracy.
Character segmentation to identify individual characters from the handwriting.
Classification of characters using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
Display of recognized text in real-time.
Support for custom datasets for training the model.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RealTime_Handwriting_Recognition_System.git
cd RealTime_Handwriting_Recognition_System
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download or prepare a dataset (if training the model):

You can use existing datasets like IAM or MNIST or your custom dataset.
Ensure the dataset is structured properly for training.
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
Model Training:

Train the model with your dataset if needed. The training script is included, and you can adjust hyperparameters as necessary.
Running the Handwriting Recognition:

Once the model is trained, use the provided script to capture handwriting input through a camera and recognize the text.
Customization:

You can customize the model architecture, preprocessing steps, and recognition logic by modifying the relevant scripts.
Technologies
Python 3.x
